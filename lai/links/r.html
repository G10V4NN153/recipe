        <h1><strong>HOW TO MAKE TAMALES</strong></h1>
            <p>The tamales are a dish that have existed before the <em>prehispanic</em> era of Mexico and this dish was for big parties, social events or offered as an tribute to the dead. Originally it was more rough because it was made from traditional vegetables like <em>pumpkin</em>, <em>chili</em> and <em>corn</em>. It was only after the <em>Spanish Conquest</em> that the tamal transformed into what we know and love today. The culture clash changed some of the vegetables for lard and pork. <strong>Fun fact: There are 3000 to 4000 familiy recipes, variations and adaptations</strong> for tamales.</p>

            <p><strong>How to make Tamales</strong></p>
            <ol>
                
                <li>Add the pork in a pot with enough water to cover and boil it on medium heat. Add <em>bay laurel</em> and <em>a piece of onion</em> and the <em>garlic.</em> <strong>Let it cook for aproximately 50 minutes.</strong> Once cooked remove from the broth and reserve the meat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile the <em>pork</em> is cooking you can let the <em>pack of dried leaves</em> soak in water, that way they are soft when wrapping up the stuffing.</li>
                <li>Place the <em>tomatoes, onions and serrano</em> on top of a small griddle (<em>comal</em>) to roast them. Rotate them and take them out once they are roasted black but not burnt. <strong>This should not take longer than 20 minutes.</strong></li>
                <li>Once finished roasting vegetables blend them with a little bit of water and create a sauce.</li>
                <li>Take the corn and take off the <em>kernel</em> with a knife. Then mix with half of the <em>lard</em> in a blender (<em>Make sure the lard is melted</em>). If the consistency is too thick continue mixing with a little bit of <em>pork broth</em>.      <strong> Let it rest for 5 minutes.</strong> Then add in the mix the last bit of <em>lard</em> and let it rest again.</li>
                <li>Take the tomato sauce and put it in a pot to boil for <strong>5 minutes</strong>. After that, add to the sauce the bits of <em>pork</em> all perfectly cooked, season them with <em>salt and pepper</em> and continue cooking for <strong>10 minutes</strong>.</li>
                <li>In a <em>steamer pot</em> put some <em>water</em> and place some <em>soft leaves</em> at the bottom for a better cooking.</li>
                <li> Take one of the soft leaves and fill them with some of the kernel dough spreading it throughout the inside of the leaf. Then take some of the pork and sauce and place it in the middle of the dough that is spread.</li>
                <li>Close and fold the <em>tamal leaf</em> in a way so that none of the suffing falls. Repeat the proccess until you are out of stuffing.</li>
                <li>Put the tamales inside of the steamer pot and cover the pot correctly so the steam doesn't leave and let it cook for <strong>an hour and a half</strong>. Make sure the water in the pot doesn't run out and refill if necessary because the steam is essential for the cooking process.</li>
                <li>Check if they are ready once the stuffing doesn't adhere to the leaf.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy with the family.</li>
