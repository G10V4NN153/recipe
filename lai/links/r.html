        <h1><strong>HOW TO MAKE TAMALES</strong></h1>
            <p>The tamales are a dish that have existed before the <em>prehispanic</em> era of Mexico and thhis dish was for big parties, social events or offered as an tribute to the dead. Originally it was more rough because it was made from traditional vegetables like <em>pumpkin</em>, <em>chili</em> and <em>corn</em>. It was only after the <em>Spanish Conquest</em> that the tamal transformed into what we know and love today. The culture clash changed some of the vegetables for lard and pork. <strong>Fun fact: There are 500 recipes that are fro tamales and 3000 to 4000 familiy recipes, variations and adaptations</strong>.</p>
