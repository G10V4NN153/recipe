    <img src="../img/index/r1.jpeg">

            <p>Before getting into the recipe here is a brief history of the volovanes. The volovanes are a flaky bread that is stuffed with various ingredients.This dish dates back to the 19th century and it was originally created by the French cook and baker <em>MArie Antonie Carem</em>. He was a main cook that made dishes for kings, emperors and tsars, <em>Careme</em> was the special cook for <em>Napoleon I</em>. The stories go that <em>Careme</em> decided to use flaky pastry to make a dish and created them; one of the assistants saw this and used the expression "<strong> <em>vol au vent</em></strong>" once he saw that the dish was bloating up so fast. It was later brought to the shores of Mexico in the <em>French Intervention</em>, where the recipe was altered and in Veracruz this snack started to get stuffed with chorizo, ham, tuna and others.</p>
