He was a main cook that made dishes for kings, emperors and tsars, Antonie Careme was the special cook for <em>Napoleon I</em>. The stories go that Careme decided to use flaky pastry and created them; one of the assistants saw this and used the expression "<strong> <em>vol au vent</em></strong>" once he saw that the dish was bloting up so fast. It was later brought to the shores of Mexico in the French Intervention where the recipe was altered and in Veracruz this snack started to get stuffed with chorizo ham tuna and others.</p>
