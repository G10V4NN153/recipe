<h1><strong>Recipes from Veracruz</strong></h1>
    <p> Veracruz is a mexican state with a lot of culture because it shares traits from the indigenous groups before the <em>Spain Conquest</em> in the 1500s but it also shares straits with the <em>French</em> during their invasion in the 1800s. This is noticeable in their food. These are some of those recipes that were influenced in one way or another and enrich the strong culture of not only Veracruz but Mexico.</p>
