# recipe
Project from TOP
In this project i am going to make a recipe website that has the how-to's make food from Veracruz.
I grew up in my childhood in Veracruz, even if at the moment I am in USA i still feel a strong connection to Veracruz
I remeber vividly the green hills and the humid breeze that hugs your body and elevates you to a sense of freedom
This is why my project will be dedicated to my old place.
